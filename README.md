$ pip install -r requirements.txt <br>

### Flask Flexibility

- Flask provides developers generous flexibility for developing their web applications.<br>
- The official documentation is very thorough, providing lots of details with well-written examples.<br>
- Flask is arguably one of Pythonâ€™s most popular web frameworks, with plenty of tutorials and libraries available to add to   your apps.<br>
- Flask is a lightweight framework with few dependencies. It takes just a few lines of Python to load Flask, and because it is    modular, you can restrict the dependencies to suit your needs.<br>
- Integration with database toolkits like SQLAlchemy, SQL databases like SQLite and MySQL, and NoSQL databases like    DynamoDB and MongoDB is relatively easy.<br>
